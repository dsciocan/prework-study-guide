        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements such as text, images and lists, which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>External CSS files need to be linked it the HTML file.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>CSS box model: Every HTML element is a box, consisting of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
            <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
            <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a unique name. Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
            <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code usually runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page,though there are ways to interrupt control flow.</li>
            <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. We can have more than one condition by using else if.</li>
            <li>The location of a data item in the array is identified with a unique number called an index. The first item in any array has an index of 0.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. The second statement is the condition. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. </li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that, when called, tells the computer how to perform a certain task. To create a function, we use the function keyword. A function has a unique name, followed by parantheses ().The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}.</li>
